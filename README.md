Listing of SwiftUI resources that target MacOS applications

SwiftUI is an amazing framework from Apple for easier application programming. The majority of code examples out there are targeted for iOS. SwiftUI works just as well on MacOS, but it's frustrating to search the Internet for MacOS examples only to find they were coded specifically for iOS.

This repo contains links to source code examples for SwiftUI apps for the Mac. Some examples may target multiple platforms, but if they don't include MacOS, you won't find them here.

In addition, most examples were quickly written just after Apple announced SwiftUI, so they contain deprecated APIs from the beta releases. The table below will try to list those as well.
